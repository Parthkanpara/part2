#practice on range function
number = list(range(8))#range function is specify the particular range ex-[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(number) #it return 0 to 7 in the list

parth = list(range(2,5))# it specify that our list range is between 2 to 5
print("The range of parth list is : ",parth)

parth1 = list(range(5,20,3)) #first argument is start list, 2nd argument is stop list and 3rd argument is for interval
print("lit i 5 to 20 with interval of 3 is : ",parth1) # It returns the list with interval of 3 digits of list


parth2 = list(range(1,200,11)) #first argument is start list, 2nd argument is stop list and 3rd argument is for interval
print("lit is 1 to 200 with interval of 11 is : ",parth2) # It returns the list with interval of 3 digits of list

#we can use range function in loops and alls so let's work on loops
